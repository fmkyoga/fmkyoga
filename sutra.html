    <h1>Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra : The Eightfold Path of Yoga</h1>
<br><p><i>-called ashtanga eight limbs
(“yogascitta vritti nirodhah” yoga is the restraint of the modification of the mind-stuff – translation by Swami Vivekananda)</i></p>
<br>
<h3>EIGHT LIMBS OF YOGA</h3>
<p>Yoga is about making balance and creating equanimity so as to live in peace, good health and harmony with the greater whole.   The eight limbs of yoga act as guidelines on how to live a healthy and balanced life.</p>
<br>
		
<ol>
<li>Yamas (Universal Morality)</li>
<li>Niyama (Personal Observances)</li>
<li>Asanas (Body postures)</li>
<li>Pranayama (Breath Control)</li>
<li>Pratyahara (Control of the Senses)</li>
<li>Dharana (Concentration and cultivating inner perceptual awareness)</li>
<li>Dhyana (Devotion, Meditation on the Divine)</li>
<li>Samadhi (Union with the Divine)</li>
</ol>
<br>
	</div></div>

<h3>YAMAS – Do unto others</h3>
<p>Yamas are broken down into five ‘wise characteristics’, rather than a list of dos and don’ts.  They tell us that our fundamental nature is compassionate, generous, honest and peaceful</p>
<br><h4>Ahimsa – Practice of non violence</h4>
<p>The word ahimsa literally mean not to injure or show cruelty to any creature or any person in any way whatsoever.  Ahimsa is, however, more than just lack of violence as adapted in yoga.  It means kindness, friendliness, and thoughtful consideration of others and things.  It also has to do with our duties and responsibilities too.  Ahimsa implies that in every situation we should adopt a considerate attitude and do no harm.</p>
<br><h4>Satya – Tell the truth</h4>
<p>Satya is truthfulness.  Satya means ‘to speak the truth’ yet it is not always desirable to speak the truth on all occasions, for it could harm someone unnecessarily.  We have to consider what we say, how we say it and in what way it could affect others.  If speaking the truth has negative consequences for another, then it is better, say nothing.</p>
<br><h4>Asteya – Don’t steal</h4>
<p>Asteya is not taking things belonging to others and not even having a desire to do so.  Having a desire ultimately leads one to stealing.  The idea of hoarding is another aspect of asteya.  Not missing what you don’t have at this moment, totally accepting what is and not regretting is Asteya.</p>
<br><h4>Brahmacharya – Consciously direct your energy</h4>
<p>Brahma - means the infinity, Charya – means moving in to it (having the mind moving into the infinity); being not interested in shapes and forms of the body and seeing the infinite is brahmacharya; though it is simplified even further into non-lust, continence and self-control.</p>
<br><h4>Aparigraha – avoid hording and greedyness</h4>
<p>To possess more than what we need is the violation of this precept.  We should only take what we have earned; if we take more, we are exploiting someone else.  Aparigraha is the ability to see the problems caused by acquisition, preservation and destruction of things, since these provoke attachment and injury.</p>
<br><br>
		
	</div></div>	<div class="central3">
				     <div class="fortext">
<h3>NIYAMAS – How to treat the Self</h3>
<p>Niyama means ‘rules’ and laws’.  These are the rules prescribed for personal observation.  Niyamas are broken into five.</p>
	<br>	<h4>Saucha – Cleanliness is important </h4>
<p>Saucha includes internal and external cleanliness.  External cleanliness means keeping our self clean; taking pure food which does not include alcohol, meat and intoxicants.  Internal cleanliness consists of purifying the mind of contaminations like anger, hatred, jealousy, pride, vanity, attachment, lust, greed and delusion.</p>
<br><h4>Santosha – Try to be content</h4>
<p>Santosha requires our willingness to enjoy exactly what each day brings, to be happy with whatever we have, whether that is a lot or a little.  It means being happy with what we have rather than being unhappy about what we don’t.</p>
<br><h4>Tapas – Do your best </h4>
<p>The word tapas literally means ‘heat’.  Tapas is the strength of being unaffected by opposites, such as heat and cold, hunger and thirst, sitting and standing etc.  Tapas also signify cleansing the inner debris existing in the body, through asanas and pranayama.  The main purpose of tapas is to make our mind pure and clean.</p>
<br><h4>Swadhyaya – Study yourself</h4>
<p>Sva – meaning self and adhyaya – meaning inquiry or examination.  Any activity that cultivates self-reflective consciousness can be considered Svadhyaya.  It means to intentionally find self-awareness in all our activities and efforts, even to the point of welcoming and accepting our limitations.  By the practice Svadhyaya desire of worldly objects diminishes and taste for spirituality increases.</p>
<br><h4>Ishvarapranidhana – Stay humble</h4>
<p>Ishvara Pranidhana is offering one’s activities to God, the original teacher, without desire for the fruit of actions.  The practice requires that we set aside some time each day to recognise that there is some omnipresent force larger than ourselves that is guiding and directing the course of our lives.</p>
<br><br>

<h3>ASANA</h3>
<p>Comfortable and steady.  Often describes as ‘posture’ asana means seat.  Yogasanas are different ways to shape our body and take seat, a position.  When we step into a pose we are creating a certain flow of energy.  This limb of yoga practice reattaches us to our body.  The control of breath and bodily posture will harmonise the flow of energy in the organism, thus creating a fertile field for the evolution of the spirit.</p>
</div><div class="central5"> <div class="fortext">
<br><h3>PRANAYAMA</h3>
<p>Prana is the life force or energy that exists everywhere and flows through you.  Pranayama is the measuring, control, and directing of the breath in order to purify and remove distractions from the mind making it easier to concentrate and meditate.  In the Yoga Sutra, the practice of pranayama and asana are considered to be the highest form of purification and self-discipline for the mind and the body.  The basic movements of pranayama are inhalation, retention of breath, and exhalation.</p>
</div></div><div class="central6"> <div class="fortext">
<br><h3>PRATYAHARA</h3>
<p>Pratyahara translates as ‘to withdraw oneself from that which nourishes the senses’.  In yoga the terms Pratyahara implies withdrawal of the senses from attachment to external objects.  In Pratyahara we separate this link between the mind and senses - the senses withdraw.  When the senses are no longer tied to external sources, the result is Pratyahara.</p>
</div></div><div class="central7"> <div class="fortext">
<br><h3>DHARANA</h3>
<p>Dharana means ‘immovable concentration of the mind’.  The essential idea is to hold the concentration or focus of attention in one direction.</p>
</div></div><div class="central8"> <div class="fortext">
<br><h3>DHYANA</h3>
<p>Dhyana means worship, or profound and abstract religious mediation.  It is perfect contemplation.  It involves concentration upon a point of focus with the intention of knowing the truth about it.  The concept holds that when one focuses their mind in concentration on an object the mind is transformed into the shape of the object.  Hence, when one focuses on the divine they become more reflective of it and they know their true nature.</p>
</div></div><div class="central9"> <div class="fortext">
<br><h3>SAMADHI</h3>
<p>The final step in the eight-fold path of yoga is the attainment of Samadhi.  Samadhi means ‘to bring together to merge’.  In the state of Samadhi the body and senses are at rest, as if asleep, yet the faculty of mind and reason are alert, as if awake; one goes beyond consciousness.  During Samadhi, we realise what it is to be an identity without differences, and how a liberated soul can enjoy pre awareness of this pure identity.  The conscious mind drops back into that unconscious oblivion from which it first emerged.</p
