	<h1>General Guidelines</h1>
		<br>
<h3> Listed below are various general guidance suggestions. You may wish to scan over these to see what resonates with you.</h3>
		<br>
		
		<br>
<ul><li>Eat at least 2 hours before the asana session.  It is difficult to perform asanas with a full stomach.  Also, do not eat or drink half an hour after the session.</li>
<li>The best time is early morning, after meditation.</li>
<li>Find a cool and ventilated, quiet place with an even, level floor.  The best place is a space reserved for Yoga and meditation, with an altar.  It is suggested not to do Yoga in the bedroom as the energy is more tamasic.</li>
<li>Perform the sequence of the postures in order.  This will ensure the proper flow of energy.</li>
<li>Try to hold each posture for at least one minute to three minutes.  It is said that holding for three minutes is the minimum time required to get all the benefits of the postures.</li>
<li>Breathe consciously during the performance of postures.  When holding the posture, the breath becomes calm and the mind focused.</li>
<li>When holding, know where to concentrate for the specific posture.</li>
<li>If there is tension, focus your attention on the tension, breathe consciously while focusing on the area, sending prana to the muscles or ligaments, and during every exhalation try to progress a little more.</li>
<li>Yoga is not a competition, so try to do what you can but observe your limit.  Always try to feel comfortable.  Never push yourself to the point of exhaustion.</li>
<li>Be aware of your body throughout the session.  Keep your mind focused inward and enjoy the practice.</li>
<li>Always relax in between the postures, with deep breathing to restore the prana and avoid fatigue.</li>
<li>If there is no time, stick to the basic 12 postures without variations, you will get the maximum benefit anyway.</li>
<li>For beginners, take the time to practice headstand by preparing your arm strength with Dolphin.</li>
<li>Keep the mind inspired by being aware of the physical and mental benefits of each posture.</li>
<li>Keep the spine flexible with forward bend, backward bend and spinal twist.  Please remove this sentence</li>
<li>Achieve balance through posture and counter posture, on both the right and left sides, holding the postures on each side for an equal length of time.</li>
<li>If you do variations, make sure that you have time for the basic postures first.  Do not skip postures.</li>
<li>It is better to practice in silence without music or chanting.</li>
<li>It is better to practice asanas with eyes closed, creating an inner focus.</li>
<li>Do not compare or compete with each other when perform in group.</li>
<li>Group performance of asanas brings about awareness of collective energy.</li>
<li>It is better to perform the asanas without any props.  It is a very natural way of exercising.</li>
<li>Use light and loose fit cotton clothing for better efficiency.</li>
<li>Use a sticky Yoga mat for better performance.</li>
<li>Always spend at least 10 minutes in Savasana at the end; this is the cream of the session.</li>
<li>To maximize the benefit of the session, keep the energy internalized and calm and do not rush right away into worldly activities.</li>
<li>Do not take a bath right away but allow the prana to remain for some time.</li>
<li>Practice daily, or at least 4 times a week, for 1-2 hours for maximum benefit.</li>
</ul>
