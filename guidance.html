	<h1>General Guidelines</h1>
		<br>
<ul><li>Eat at least 2 hours before the asana session.  It is difficult to perform asanas with a full stomach.  Also, do not eat or drink half an hour after the session.</li>
<li>The best time is early morning, after meditation.</li>
<li>Find a cool and ventilated, quiet place with an even, level floor.  The best place is a space reserved for Yoga and meditation, with an altar.  It is suggested not to do Yoga in the bedroom as the energy is more tamasic.</li>
<li>Perform the sequence of the postures in order.  This will ensure the proper flow of energy.</li>
<li>Try to hold each posture for at least one minute to three minutes.  It is said that holding for three minutes is the minimum time required to get all the benefits of the postures.</li>
<li>Breathe consciously during the performance of postures.  When holding the posture, the breath becomes calm and the mind focused.</li>
<li>When holding, know where to concentrate for the specific posture.</li>
<li>If there is tension, focus your attention on the tension, breathe consciously while focusing on the area, sending prana to the muscles or ligaments, and during every exhalation try to progress a little more.</li>
<li>Yoga is not a competition, so try to do what you can but observe your limit.  Always try to feel comfortable.  Never push yourself to the point of exhaustion.</li>
<li>Be aware of your body throughout the session.  Keep your mind focused inward and enjoy the practice.</li>
<li>Always relax in between the postures, with deep breathing to restore the prana and avoid fatigue.</li>
<li>If there is no time, stick to the basic 12 postures without variations, you will get the maximum benefit anyway.</li>
<li>For beginners, take the time to practice headstand by preparing your arm strength with Dolphin.</li>
<li>The headstand cycle goes first and the standing cycle goes last because of the spiritual principle of turning inward first to find inner balance (headstand inverts all energies, stimulating the highest chakra, going against normal tendencies, after which the energy is flowing properly) then tuning the mind outward and trying to achieve balance and composition with worldly activities (standing postures are performed with the focus on external object to ground oneself).</li>
<li>The sequence of the postures follows the chakras, stimulating the chakras from the top down.</li>
<li>Keep the mind inspired by being aware of the physical and mental benefits of each posture.</li>
<li>Keep the spine flexible with forward bend, backward bend and spinal twist.  Please remove this sentence</li>
<li>Achieve balance through posture and counter posture, on both the right and left sides, holding the postures on each side for an equal length of time.</li>
<li>If you do variations, make sure that you have time for the basic postures first.  Do not skip postures.</li>
<li>It is better to practice in silence without music or chanting.</li>
<li>It is better to practice asanas with eyes closed, creating an inner focus.</li>
<li>Do not compare or compete with each other when perform in group.</li>
<li>Group performance of asanas brings about awareness of collective energy.</li>
<li>It is better to perform the asanas without any props.  It is a very natural way of exercising.</li>
<li>Use light and loose fit cotton clothing for better efficiency.</li>
<li>Use a sticky Yoga mat for better performance.</li>
<li>Always spend at least 10 minutes in Savasana at the end; this is the cream of the session.</li>
<li>To maximize the benefit of the session, keep the energy internalized and calm and do not rush right away into worldly activities.</li>
<li>Do not take a bath right away but allow the prana to remain for some time.</li>
<li>Practice daily, or at least 4 times a week, for 1-2 hours for maximum benefit.</li>
</ul>
	
	<p>Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra : The Eightfold Path of Yoga – called ashtanga eight limbs
(“yogascitta vritti nirodhah” yoga is the restraint of the modification of the mind-stuff – translation by Swami Vivekananda)

EIGHT LIMBS OF YOGA
Yoga is about making balance and creating equanimity so as to live in peace, good health and harmony with the greater whole.   The eight limbs of yoga act as guidelines on how to live a healthy and balanced life.

1.Yamas (Universal Morality)
2.Niyama (Personal Observances)
3.Asanas (Body postures)
4.Pranayama (Breath Control)
5.Pratyahara (Control of the Senses)
6.Dharana (Concentration and cultivating inner perceptual awareness)
7.Dhyana (Devotion, Meditation on the Divine)
8.Samadhi (Union with the Divine)


YAMAS – Do unto others
Yamas are broken down into five ‘wise characteristics’, rather than a list of dos and don’ts.  They tell us that our fundamental nature is compassionate, generous, honest and peaceful
Ahimsa – Practice of non violence
The word ahimsa literally mean not to injure or show cruelty to any creature or any person in any way whatsoever.  Ahimsa is, however, more than just lack of violence as adapted in yoga.  It means kindness, friendliness, and thoughtful consideration of others and things.  It also has to do with our duties and responsibilities too.  Ahimsa implies that in every situation we should adopt a considerate attitude and do no harm.
Satya – Tell the truth
Satya is truthfulness.  Satya means ‘to speak the truth’ yet it is not always desirable to speak the truth on all occasions, for it could harm someone unnecessarily.  We have to consider what we say, how we say it and in what way it could affect others.  If speaking the truth has negative consequences for another, then it is better, say nothing.
Asteya – Don’t steal
Asteya is not taking things belonging to others and not even having a desire to do so.  Having a desire ultimately leads one to stealing.  The idea of hoarding is another aspect of asteya.  Not missing what you don’t have at this moment, totally accepting what is and not regretting is Asteya.
Brahmacharya – Consciously direct your energy
Brahma - means the infinity, Charya – means moving in to it (having the mind moving into the infinity); being not interested in shapes and forms of the body and seeing the infinite is brahmacharya; though it is simplified even further into non-lust, continence and self-control.
Aparigraha – avoid hording and greedyness
To possess more than what we need is the violation of this precept.  We should only take what we have earned; if we take more, we are exploiting someone else.  Aparigraha is the ability to see the problems caused by acquisition, preservation and destruction of things, since these provoke attachment and injury.

NIYAMAS – How to treat the Self
Niyama means ‘rules’ and laws’.  These are the rules prescribed for personal observation.  Niyamas are broken into five.
Saucha – Cleanliness is important
Saucha includes internal and external cleanliness.  External cleanliness means keeping our self clean; taking pure food which does not include alcohol, meat and intoxicants.  Internal cleanliness consists of purifying the mind of contaminations like anger, hatred, jealousy, pride, vanity, attachment, lust, greed and delusion.
Santosha – Try to be content
Santosha requires our willingness to enjoy exactly what each day brings, to be happy with whatever we have, whether that is a lot or a little.  It means being happy with what we have rather than being unhappy about what we don’t.
Tapas – Do your best 
The word tapas literally means ‘heat’.  Tapas is the strength of being unaffected by opposites, such as heat and cold, hunger and thirst, sitting and standing etc.  Tapas also signify cleansing the inner debris existing in the body, through asanas and pranayama.  The main purpose of tapas is to make our mind pure and clean.
Swadhyaya – Study yourself
Sva – meaning self and adhyaya – meaning inquiry or examination.  Any activity that cultivates self-reflective consciousness can be considered Svadhyaya.  It means to intentionally find self-awareness in all our activities and efforts, even to the point of welcoming and accepting our limitations.  By the practice Svadhyaya desire of worldly objects diminishes and taste for spirituality increases.
Ishvarapranidhana – Stay humble
Ishvara Pranidhana is offering one’s activities to God, the original teacher, without desire for the fruit of actions.  The practice requires that we set aside some time each day to recognise that there is some omnipresent force larger than ourselves that is guiding and directing the course of our lives.


ASANA
Comfortable and steady.  Often describes as ‘posture’ asana means seat.  Yogasanas are different ways to shape our body and take seat, a position.  When we step into a pose we are creating a certain flow of energy.  This limb of yoga practice reattaches us to our body.  The control of breath and bodily posture will harmonise the flow of energy in the organism, thus creating a fertile field for the evolution of the spirit.

PRANAYAMA
Prana is the life force or energy that exists everywhere and flows through you.  Pranayama is the measuring, control, and directing of the breath in order to purify and remove distractions from the mind making it easier to concentrate and meditate.  In the Yoga Sutra, the practice of pranayama and asana are considered to be the highest form of purification and self-discipline for the mind and the body.  The basic movements of pranayama are inhalation, retention of breath, and exhalation.

PRATYAHARA
Pratyahara translates as ‘to withdraw oneself from that which nourishes the senses’.  In yoga the terms Pratyahara implies withdrawal of the senses from attachment to external objects.  In Pratyahara we separate this link between the mind and senses - the senses withdraw.  When the senses are no longer tied to external sources, the result is Pratyahara.

DHARANA
Dharana means ‘immovable concentration of the mind’.  The essential idea is to hold the concentration or focus of attention in one direction.

DHYANA
Dhyana means worship, or profound and abstract religious mediation.  It is perfect contemplation.  It involves concentration upon a point of focus with the intention of knowing the truth about it.  The concept holds that when one focuses their mind in concentration on an object the mind is transformed into the shape of the object.  Hence, when one focuses on the divine they become more reflective of it and they know their true nature.

SAMADHI
The final step in the eight-fold path of yoga is the attainment of Samadhi.  Samadhi means ‘to bring together to merge’.  In the state of Samadhi the body and senses are at rest, as if asleep, yet the faculty of mind and reason are alert, as if awake; one goes beyond consciousness.  During Samadhi, we realise what it is to be an identity without differences, and how a liberated soul can enjoy pre awareness of this pure identity.  The conscious mind drops back into that unconscious oblivion from which it first emerged.</p>
	
	<h1>Coming in to Presence </h1>

<p>Feel the body from within.  Be aware and watchful.  Just look; watching and feeling without judgement. This will put you in touch with your emotions – emotions are a reflexion of your thoughts.
Feel your emotions and ask without judging what is going on inside me.
If the emotion has a strong physical point it may be a reflexion of an amplified and energised thought pattern.
If the is no emotion then take your attention deeper within to a place of peace and stillness, and fill your whole being with love and joy, kindness and compassion towards yourself; and accepting the isness of being and honour the present moment.
	In the deep dimension of being you are whole.</p>


	<h1>Benefits of being mindful</h1>
	<p>
		
Being mindful of what is happening right now in this moment can help us physiologically, energetically, mentally and emotionally…….our whole well-being improves when we’re being mindful.  
Mindfulness seems to bring a lift and lightness to life.  Life becomes effortless; and with continued practice we can begin to change set mind patterns, open to compassion and kindness and love, make different choices and not repeat the same old patterns, and let go of old and tired emotions that no longer serve us.  
Being consciously aware, noticing, knowingly feeling, right here, right now, without judgement, adding drama, without taking anything away from the experience; to just be.
As we pay attention to our breath it begins to slow down, the heartbeat slows down, the breath steadies and our body begins to soften.  As a result, our stress begins to evaporate and stress levels decline.  The blood pressure drops, digestion improve, more oxygen gets into the body, the mind quietens and the body begins to heal. 
Mindfulness is an on-going practice.  The more you do it the easier it becomes….but you have to keep practicing mindfulness or the chattering mind takes over and clouds what is real.</p>
