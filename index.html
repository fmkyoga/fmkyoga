		<h1>YOGA- FRANCES KELLY</h1>
	


		<br>
<h3>QUALIFIED YOGA TEACHER OFFERING LESSONS</h3>	
			<p> Hi, my name is Frances Kelly.</p>

<p>I am a trained and registered Hatha Yoga Teacher. 
	I studied yoga with Yoga Scotland (YS Charitable Trust). 
	I completed the YS Foundation course in 2010/11, spent the next year immersed in my practice and then went on to complete the YS 2-year Yoga Teacher 
	Training Diploma in 2012/14; and in January 2017 I gave up my career as a business manager to become self-employed as a professional Hatha Yoga Teacher.</p>

<p>I first discovered yoga by chance at the age of 16. I, 
	curiously, attended my first yoga class at the local community centre. 
	I was late and the class had started. It was packed out.
	I was directed to a small space at the back of the hall with some distain for being late and suggesting I could perhaps just spectate. 
	In those days there were no sticky mats and so my first practice was on bare floorboards. Later, I would bring a blanket to classes. 
	This was in the early 70s and yoga was practised in cold and draughty community halls: schools, churches. However, 
	it never deterred me and I have been practising yoga (sometime on and off) ever since. Initially,
	I was more interested on the asana (postures) practice rather than breathing techniques and meditation.
	I loved the elegance, gracefulness and poise of the beautiful postures. 
	Holding poses and tweaking shapes moving deeper into the asana. 
	I didn’t realise that at the time that we were practising BKS Iyengar style of yoga and during my Yoga Scotland training years the style was TKV Desikachar. 
	Both Iyengar and Desikachar were taught by Krishnamacharya the father of modern yoga.</p>

<p>Throughout the years my practice has progressed and I have developed naturally a keen interest in pranayama (breathing techniques),
	mindfulness, meditation and relaxation; and now those aspects form the foundation on my personal practice. 
	My approach and teaching of yoga is to
	subtly lead the asana through the breath into the uniqueness of the individual body and not take the body into the uniqueness of the shape.</p>

<p>My continued personal development includes physical practices:
	yin and yang yoga postures, safety in asana (postures), 
	mindfulness and meditation, breathing techniques, yoga anatomy and physiology, 
	yoga philosophy: Bhadavad Ghita, Vedas, Sutras,
	as well as studying the various pioneering approaches to yoga such as Scaravelli approach 
	(a unique form of yoga exercise in freeing the body in order to ‘set the mind free’);
	and the Feldenkrais method
	(a system designed to promote bodily and mental efficiency and well-being by conscious analysis of neuromuscular activity
	via exercises which improve flexibility and coordination and increase ease and range of motion) applied to the principles and practice of yoga. 
	I am also interested in Autogenic therapy and yoga (a powerful mind and body technique involving simple relaxation and body awareness exercises).</p>

<p>Teaching yoga is a privilege and a pleasure.</p>

<p>One conscious breath is a meditation</p>

<p>Om Shanti - Peace</p><br>
