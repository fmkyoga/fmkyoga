		<h1>YOGA- FRANCES KELLY</h1>
	


		<hr>
<h3>QUALIFIED YOGA TEACHER OFFERING LESSONS</h3>	
			
			<hr>
			
			<p> Hi, my name is Frances Kelly. I am a trained and registered Hatha Yoga Teacher. </p><br>
			
		 <p>	I studied yoga with Yoga Scotland (YS Charitable Trust). 
   I completed the YS Foundation course in 2010/11, then spent the next year immersed in my practice before successfully completing
    the 2012/14 YS 2-year Yoga Teacher Training Diploma; and in January 2017 I gave up my career as a business manager to 
    become self-employed as a professional Hatha Yoga Teacher.</p><br>

<p>I first discovered yoga by chance at the age of 16. I, curiously, attended my first yoga class at the local community centre. 
	I was late and the class had started. It was packed out. I was directed to a small space at the
	back of the hall with some distain for being late and suggesting I could perhaps just spectate.
	In those days there were no sticky mats and so my first practice was on bare floorboards. Later, I would bring a blanket to classes. This was in the early 70s and yoga was practised in cold and draughty community halls: schools, churches. However, it never deterred me and I have been practising yoga (sometimes on and off) ever since. Initially, I was more interested on practising asana (postures) rather than breathing techniques and meditation. I loved the elegance, poise and gracefulness of postures. Holding poses and tweaking shapes moving in and out of asana. I didn’t realise at the time that we were practising BKS Iyengar style of yoga; and later during my Yoga Scotland training years the style was TKV Desikachar.
	Both Iyengar and Desikachar were taught by Krishnamacharya the father of modern yoga.</p><br>

<p>Throughout the years my practice has progressed and I have developed naturally a keen interest in pranayama (breathing techniques), mindfulness, meditation and relaxation; and now these aspects form the foundation on my personal practice. My approach to yoga and teaching method is gentle: subtly taking the asana into the uniqueness of the individual body, moving with and through the breath; resting in the awareness of what is and not forcing the body into the shape of the asana.</p>
<br>
<p>My continued personal development includes physical practices:
	yin and yang yoga postures, safety in asana (postures), 
	mindfulness and meditation, breathing techniques, yoga anatomy and physiology, 
	yoga philosophy: Bhadavad Ghita, Vedas, Sutras,
	as well as studying the various pioneering approaches to yoga such as Scaravelli approach 
	<i>(a unique form of yoga exercise in freeing the body in order to ‘set the mind free’);</i>
	and the Feldenkrais method
	<i>(a system designed to promote bodily and mental efficiency and well-being by conscious analysis of neuromuscular activity
	via exercises which improve flexibility and coordination and increase ease and range of motion) </i>applied to the principles and practice of yoga. 
	I am also interested in Autogenic therapy and yoga <i>(a powerful mind and body technique involving simple relaxation and body awareness exercises).</i></p>
<br>
<p>Teaching yoga is a privilege and a pleasure.</p>

<p>One conscious breath is a meditation</p>

<p>Om Shanti - Peace</p><br>
