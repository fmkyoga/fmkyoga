	<h1>Recent feedback for the lockdown 2020 Zoom yoga classes 
</h1>

<p>Thanks for the class yesterday. I enjoyed it.  The twists were good to do as usual  The pace worked well. </p>

<p>It was really helpful for me to switch off and apologies for being late in as I took a phone call earlier which went on and on. </p>

<p>Wonderful class really liked you constructions for pyramid, really helped me, as does shoulder stand. </p>

<p>I loved the twists and kneeling folds, they were great, and your development of reverse triangle (cant recall now if it was triangle now, I’ll have to see if I can remember how to do it) from kneeling W2 was terrific. That sequence was so good or me. I cant tell you how encouraging and restorative your classes are for me on physical and personal level. </p>

<p>Really enjoyed yesterday’s class - twists seem to work well on Zoom and you gave us a great variety.
Hard for you though directing us with ‘arms and legs’ moving in different spaces - and then to be repeated on the other side!! </p>
<p>The p
ace of the class was fine for me - dynamic early but lovely wind down before relaxation.
I do hope you are enjoying teaching this way and like lockdown it is not becoming onerous. I’m finding my other Zoom classes work too except for the lack of social interaction pre/post class </p>

<p>Thanks for the relaxing yin class today-really enjoyed it </p>
<p>fantastic class, found my many tight bits, getting more of them so this was excellent to 'get' them </p>
<p>Thank you for great class today </p>

<p>What a brilliant class I love the dialogue making us think about the energy healing and love we are creating through the practice THANK YOU for giving us this gift 💝🙏🙏☀️ </p></div>
