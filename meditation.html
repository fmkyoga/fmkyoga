	<h1>Benefits of being mindful</h1>
<br>
<p>Being mindful of what is happening right now in this moment can help us physiologically, energetically, mentally and emotionally…….our whole well-being improves when we’re being mindful.  </p>
<p>Mindfulness seems to bring a lift and lightness to life.  Life becomes effortless; and with continued practice we can begin to change set mind patterns, open to compassion and kindness and love, make different choices and not repeat the same old patterns, and let go of old and tired emotions that no longer serve us.  </p>
<p>Being consciously aware, noticing, knowingly feeling, right here, right now, without judgement, adding drama, without taking anything away from the experience; to just be.</p>
<p>As we pay attention to our breath it begins to slow down, the heartbeat slows down, the breath steadies and our body begins to soften.  As a result, our stress begins to evaporate and stress levels decline.  The blood pressure drops, digestion improve, more oxygen gets into the body, the mind quietens and the body begins to heal. </p>
<p>Mindfulness is an on-going practice.  The more you do it the easier it becomes….but you have to keep practicing mindfulness or the chattering mind takes over and clouds what is real.</p>
