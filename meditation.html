	<h1>Benefits of being mindful</h1>
<br>
<p>Being mindful of what is happening right now in this moment can help us physiologically, energetically, mentally and emotionally…….our whole well-being improves when we’re being mindful.  </p>
<br><p>Mindfulness seems to bring a lift and lightness to life.  Life becomes effortless; and with continued practice we can begin to change set mind patterns, open to compassion and kindness and love, make different choices and not repeat the same old patterns, and let go of old and tired emotions that no longer serve us.  </p>
<br><p>Being consciously aware, noticing, knowingly feeling, right here, right now, without judgement, adding drama, without taking anything away from the experience; to just be.</p>
<br><p>As we pay attention to our breath it begins to slow down, the heartbeat slows down, the breath steadies and our body begins to soften.  As a result, our stress begins to evaporate and stress levels decline.  The blood pressure drops, digestion improve, more oxygen gets into the body, the mind quietens and the body begins to heal. </p>
<br><p>Mindfulness is an on-going practice.  The more you do it the easier it becomes….but you have to keep practicing mindfulness or the chattering mind takes over and clouds what is real.</p>

	<h1>Coming in to Presence </h1>
<br>
<p>Feel the body from within.  Be aware and watchful.  Just look; watching and feeling without judgement. This will put you in touch with your emotions – emotions are a reflexion of your thoughts.</p>
<br><p>Feel your emotions and ask without judging what is going on inside me.</p>
<br><p>If the emotion has a strong physical point it may be a reflexion of an amplified and energised thought pattern.</p>
<br><p>If the is no emotion then take your attention deeper within to a place of peace and stillness, and fill your whole being with love and joy, kindness and compassion towards yourself; and accepting the isness of being and honour the present moment.</p>
<br><p>In the deep dimension of being you are whole.</p>
